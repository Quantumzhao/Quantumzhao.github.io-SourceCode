### About this site:

This website is designed by myself. Also, thanks for **@Mike Guo's** contribution to its source code.

This overall style may appear a little bit too simple and sometimes naive. But I think that doesn't matter, for these defects would be eliminated in the following months.

### About Me:

I'm a high school student who will graduate soon and step into university.

To myself, I love both industrial design and computer programming, which in turn much convenience when developing any program because I can take total control of my product from graphics to algorithms.
